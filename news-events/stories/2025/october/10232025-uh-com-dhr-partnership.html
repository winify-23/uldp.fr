                              <li><strong>Major partnership expands UH’s reach to the Rio Grande Valley:</strong> The University of Houston and DHR Health Hospital System have partnered to create
                                 the UH Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine and DHR Health Medical Research
                                 and Education Center, supported by $15 million in state funding.</li>

                                 education aimed at improving care in one of Texas’ most medically underserved regions
                                 and tackling health issues that disproportionately affect South Texans.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Strengthening Texas’ Health Workforce Pipeline:</strong> The collaboration builds on a longstanding UH-DHR partnership to train the next generation
                                 of physicians and health professionals, expanding UH’s statewide impact and reinforcing
                                 its role as a leader in building a healthier Texas.</li>

                        <p>The University of Houston and DHR Health Hospital System today announced an agreement
                           to establish The University of Houston Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine
                           and DHR Health Medical Research and Education Center in the Rio Grande Valley. Supported
                           by a $15 million state appropriation, the new center will serve as a hub for advancing
                           medical research, expanding health education programs and improving access to health
                           care across one of Texas’ most medically underserved regions.</p>
                        
                        <p>The collaboration brings together UH’s expertise in health sciences and DHR Health’s
                           extensive clinical presence in South Texas to expand opportunities for medical students,
                           residents and researchers while directly addressing the state’s most pressing health
                           challenges.</p>
                        
                        <p>“The University of Houston is committed to building a healthier Texas, and that means
                           expanding our reach to communities where the need is greatest,” said Renu Khator,
                           president of the University of Houston. “Through this partnership with DHR Health,
                           we are strengthening the state’s health workforce pipeline, expanding our capacity
                           for medical research and ensuring the people of the Rio Grande Valley have greater
                           access to the care and innovation they deserve.”</p>
                        
                        <h2>Advancing Research, Education and Health Access</h2>
                        
                        <p>As part of the agreement, DHR Health will construct a new facility that will house
                           joint research initiatives, clinical training programs and educational partnerships
                           aimed at improving outcomes for conditions that disproportionately affect the Rio
                           Grande Valley region. The facility will also provide dedicated space for UH faculty,
                           students and researchers to engage in clinical and translational research.</p>
                        
                        <p>“This partnership represents the next step in our vision to grow a truly statewide
                           medical school that trains the next generation of physicians where they are needed
                           most,” said Jonathan A. McCullers, UH vice president of health affairs and dean of
                           the Fertitta College of Medicine. “By combining the academic strength and clinical
                           excellence of UH and DHR Health, we are creating an anchor for medical education and
                           discovery in South Texas, one that will improve lives and advance the practice of
                           medicine across the state.”</p>
                        
                        <p>DHR Health, one of the largest physician-owned hospitals in the nation, operates more
                           than 70 facilities — including five hospitals — across the Rio Grande Valley and serves
                           as a major training site for physician residencies, nursing and pharmacy programs.
                           The system is home to the DHR Health Institute for Research and Development, a leading
                           center for clinical research in South Texas.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Building on a Longstanding Partnership</h2>
                        
                        <p>The establishment of this new Medical Research and Education Center builds on a longtime
                           partnership between UH and DHR Health. In 2017, the organizations launched the UH
                           College of Pharmacy Rio Grande Valley Pharm.D. Satellite Program to expand clinical
                           pharmacy services, engage in research projects to improve health outcomes, and provide
                           new education and training opportunities for future pharmacists to serve communities
                           in the RGV.</p>
                        
                        <p>“Our mission has always been to elevate the quality of health care and medical education
                           in the Rio Grande Valley,” said Susan Turley, president of DHR Health. “Partnering
                           with the University of Houston allows us to accelerate that mission and bring new
                           resources, research collaborations and training opportunities to the region. Together,
                           we are investing in a healthier future for South Texas.”</p>
                        
                        <p>The establishment of the Medical Research and Education Center marks a major step
                           in UH’s long-term strategy to strengthen the state’s health care infrastructure and
                           expand its footprint as a comprehensive health sciences university.</p>
