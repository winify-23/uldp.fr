<h2>Tuition Payment Statement Form Filing Instructions</h2>
<p>An eligible educational institution, such as a college or university, in which you are enrolled and an insurer who makes reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related expenses to you, must furnish this statement to you. You, or the person who may claim you as a dependent, may be able to take either the tuition and fees deduction or claim an education credit on Form 1040 or 1040A for the qualified tuition and related expenses that were actually paid in 2008. Institutions may report either payments received in box 1 or amounts billed in box 2. The amount shown in box 1 or 2 may represent an amount other than the amount actually paid in 2008. Your institution must include its name, address and information contact telephone number on this statement. It may also include contact information for a service provider. Although the service provider may be able to answer certain questions about the statement, do not contact them or the filer for explanations of the requirements for (and how to figure) any allowable tuition and fees deduction or education credit that you may claim. For more information about the deduction or credit, see Pub. 970, Tax Benefits for Education, Form 8863, Education Credits, and the Form 1040 or 1040A instructions.</p>
<h3>Compare a # box to the list below to see what is required in that space:</h3>
<p><img alt="1098-T" src="https://uh.edu/UH%20-%20Web%20Site/images/1098-T.jpg" border="0" height="199" width="433" /></p>
<p>(&#8220;see instructions and additional information for students below.&#8221;)</p>
<p><b>Box 1</b> - Shows the total payments received from any source for qualified tuition and related expenses less any related 'reimbursements or refunds. However, Box 1 will never have an amount because the University of Houston is required to report the amount BILLED (see Box 2).</p>
<p><b>Box 2</b> - Shows the total amounts BILLED for qualified tuition and related expenses less any related reductions in charges</p>
<p><b>Box 3</b> - Shows whether your institution changed its method of reporting for 2008. It has changed its method of reporting if the method (payments received or amounts billed) used for 2008 is different than the reporting method used for 2005. You should be aware of this change in figuring your allowable tuition and fees deduction or education credits. The deduction and the credits are allowable only for amounts paid during the year and not amounts reported as billed, but not paid, during the year.</p>
<p><b>Box 4</b> - Shows any adjustment made for a prior year for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported on a prior year Form 1098-T. This amount may reduce any allowable education credit you may claim for the prior year. See Form 8863 or Pub. 970 for more information.</p>
<p><b>Box 5</b> - Shows the total of all scholarships or grants administered and processed by the eligible educational institution. The amount of scholarships or grants for the calendar year (including those not reported by the institution) may reduce the amount of any allowable tuition and fees deduction or the education credit you may claim for the year.</p>
<p><b>Box 6</b> - Shows adjustments to scholarships or grants for a prior year. This amount may affect the amount of any allowable tuition and fees deduction or education credit you may claim for the prior year. See Pub. 970 for how to report these amounts.</p>
<p><b>Box 7</b> - Shows whether the amount in box 1 or 2 includes amounts for an academic period beginning January-March 2009. See Pub. 970 for how to report these amounts.</p>
<p><b>Box 8</b> - Shows whether you are considered to be carrying at least one&#173; half the normal full-time workload for your course of study at the reporting institution. If you are at ]Past a half-time student for at least one academic period that begins during the year, you meet one of the requirements for the Hope credit. You do not have to meet the workload requirement to qualify for the tuition and fees deduction or the lifetime learning credit.</p>
<p><b>Box 9</b> - Shows whether you are considered to be enrolled in a program leading to a graduate degree, graduate-level certificate, or other recognized graduate-level educational credential. If you are enrolled in a graduate program, you are not eligible for the Hope credit, but you may qualify for the tuition and fees deduction or the lifetime learning credit.</p>
<p><b>Box 10</b> - Shows the total amount of reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related expenses made by an insurer. The amount of reimbursements or refunds for the calendar year may reduce the amount of any allowable tuition and fees deduction or education credit you may claim for the year.</p>
<h2><b>Additional Information for Students</b></h2>
<p>A. Under section 25A and the regulations there under, the taxpayer may claim an education tax credit only with respect to qualified tuition and related expenses actually paid during the calendar year; and that the taxpayer may not be able to claim an education tax credit with respect to the entire amount of payments received, or amounts billed, for qualified tuition and related expenses reported for the calendar year.</p>
<p>B. The amount of any scholarships or grants reported for the calendar year and other similar amounts not reported (because they are not administered and processed by the institution) may reduce the amount of any allowable education tax credit for the taxable year.</p>
<p>C. The amount of any reimbursements or refunds of payments received, or reductions in charges, for qualified tuition and related expenses, or any reductions to the amount of scholarships or grants, reported by the institution with respect to the individual for a prior calendar year may affect the amount of any allowable education tax credit for the prior calendar year (and may result in an increase in tax liability for the year of the refund).</p>
<p>D.The amount of any reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related expenses reported by an insurer may reduce the amount of an allowable education tax credit for a taxable year (and may result in an increase in tax liability for the year of the refund).</p>
<p>E. Form 1098-T reports total amounts BILLED (not received) by the University of Houston for qualified and related expenses during the calendar year.</p>
