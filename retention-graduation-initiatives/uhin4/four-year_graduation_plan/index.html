                     <p>The University of Houston is committed to creating an educational environment in which
                        student success can be ensured. In support of this goal, we strive to provide students
                        with tools and resources needed to facilitate degree completion. This graduation plan
                        has been developed as a mechanism to help students identify and pursue clear paths
                        for completing their undergraduate degree in a timely manner. Graduation within four
                        academic years of initial fall enrollment at the University of Houston is ensured
                        conditioned upon the satisfaction of student eligibility requirements as outlined
                        below.</p>
                     
                     <p class="alert alert-info">Please note: The Four Year Graduation Plan provides students with access to a fixed
                        rate tuition option. Students are not automatically placed into the fixed rate tuition.
                        Students must choose either the fixed or variable rate.</p>

                     <h3>Initial Eligibility Requirements</h3>
                     
                     <p>To be eligible for the 2025-2026 Freshman Four-Year Graduation Plan, the student must
                        sign up through AccessUH by the published deadline, <strong>September 2, 2025</strong>, and satisfy the following conditions:</p>
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>Enroll at the University of Houston for the first time as a freshman during the Summer
                           2025 or Fall 2025 semester.</li>
                        
                        <li>Be admitted to an eligible major or as an undeclared student at the time of enrollment
                           for the Fall 2025 semester. Enrollment in non-degree, non-academic professional and
                           public programs or other off-campus programs does not qualify. Ineligible major information
                           can be found here.</li>
                        
                        <li>Enroll in at least 15 semester credit hours at the University of Houston in the Fall
                           2025 semester. Developmental courses are not counted toward the 15 credit requirement.</li>
                        </ol>
                     
                     <h3>Continued Eligibility Requirements</h3>
                     
                     <p>To remain eligible for the 2025-2026 Freshman Four-Year Graduation Plan, the student
                        must satisfy the following conditions:</p>
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>Successfully declare an eligible major by the first day of the Fall 2026 semester
                           if initially admitted to the University of Houston as an undeclared student.</li>
                        
                        <li>Successfully complete a minimum of one quarter of the required credits for the selected
                           eligible degree program each academic year. Most University of Houston undergraduate
                           degree programs consist of 120 total credit hours requiring successful completion
                           of at least 15 applicable credit hours per semester or 30 credit hours per academic
                           year for continued plan eligibility. A list of minimum semester or annual credit hours
                           for eligible majors can be found <a href="https://www.uh.edu/retention-graduation-initiatives/uhin4/maps/index.php">here</a>; specific degree requirements for each major can be found in the <a href="http://publications.uh.edu/index.php">undergraduate catalog</a>.</li>
                        
                        <li>Continuous enrollment each fall and spring during the term of the plan. Summer enrollment
                           is not required but credits completed during the summer can be used toward the minimum
                           credits required for the selected eligible major. Any other interruptions of attendance,
                           with the exception of participation in a University sponsored cooperative employment/learning
                           experience, may result in disqualification from the plan. Students participating in
                           a University sponsored cooperative employment/learning experience are responsible
                           for meeting with their academic advisor prior said participation to ensure involvement
                           does not delay four year graduation.</li>
                        
                        <li>Remain in good academic standing each semester during the term of the four-year agreement
                           and act on advice provided by UHin4 staff to remain on track for four-year graduation.</li>
                        
                        <li>Meet applicable university, college and department academic requirements pertaining
                           to course and degree progress.</li>
                        
                        <li>Resolve issues such as advising holds and financial holds that may delay timely enrollment.</li>
                        
                        <li>Meet with an academic advisor prior to the designated enrollment appointment each
                           semester to discuss course selection and progress toward graduation.</li>
                        
                        <li>Enroll for each semester within 48 hours of the start of the designated enrollment
                           appointment.</li>

                        <li>Monitor degree progress and act on advice provided by academic advisors to remain

                        Plan but is unable to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in four consecutive academic
                        years due to course unavailability, the appropriate department(s) and college(s) will
                        first try to substitute an equivalent course(s) or an independent study assignment(s),
                        or to waive the requirement(s) to be met by the unavailable course(s). If the Dean(s)
                        of the college(s) determines that none of these adjustments is academically acceptable,
                        the appropriate academic college(s) at the University of Houston will pay the tuition
                        for the student to take the course(s) required for degree completion within the next
                        academic year at the University of Houston.</p>
